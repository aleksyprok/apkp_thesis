% \section*{Acknowledgements}

% I want to thank several people for their aid and support in the completion of this thesis.

% Firstly, I am incredibly grateful to my primary supervisor, Alan, for his help and guidance throughout my PhD. His enthusiasm and expertise played a crucial role in making this work possible. I want to thank my co-supervisors, Ineke and Andy. I found Ineke's advice really useful, and she ensured I didn't stray off on too many tangents. I found Andy's constructive criticism and ability to think about problems from a physical and a mathematical perspective very insightful.

% Secondly, I'd like to thank all of the Maths department members and Steve's football players. A special thanks to my office mates and everyone else for the long lunch breaks and interesting conversations. Thanks to Callan for being a great house/office-mate throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

% Last but not least, I would like to thank my family. Thank you to my parents and siblings for always believing in me and encouraging me through the highs and lows. I am also grateful to Isobel and Ken for their advice and assistance.
