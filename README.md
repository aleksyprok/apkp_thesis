# Readme

This is the GitHub page associated with Alexander Prokopyszyn's thesis, which Prof Alan Hood supervised at the University of St Andrews.

It includes all the relevant files and code used to produce this thesis including LaTeX files, maple files and python files.

To view the maple files, you will need a copy of Maple installed on your machine. Exported pdfs have been included in Maple/Chapter 4 to enable users to read the files without a copy of Maple installed on their device.

Note that the copy of the thesis here (`apkp_thesis.pdf`) is the most up-to-date version available.
